# BRANCHING

According to my research, there are 4 main types of branching strategies:

1. Trunk Based Development
2. Release Branching
3. Feature Branching
4. Story or Task Branching
	
Because we are doing agile & scrum, and user-stories is very popular using this methodology - I have decided on using Story/Task Branching for my git project.

I will therefore have 4 main braches per Repository:
1. Story XYZ - this will be the first branch used when writing code. All code will first be pushed in here.
2. Integration - this branch will be for code that has passed all tests and are ready to be pushed to QA
3. QA - This is code that have passed the QA stage and is ready to be pushed to staging
4. Staging - This code is ready to be pushed to production.
